## Categories

Jekyll Chirpy allows a maximum of 2 categories per post.

| Category | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Training** | Lifting, strength, gym sessions, programmes |
| **Nutrition** | Meals, recipes, macros, supplements, diet protocols |
| **Video** | Filming, camera settings, footage, editing, gear |
| **Journal** | Always paired with one of the above — personal logs, snapshots, stories, reflective posts |

Every post uses Journal as the second category. It reflects that all posts are personal documentation with your voice, not generic reference material.
