## Categories

Jekyll Chirpy allows a maximum of 2 categories per post.

| Category | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Training** | Any post about lifting, strength, gym sessions, programmes, nutrition for training |
| **Journal** | Personal logs, snapshots, weekly updates, reflective posts — the "story" posts |
| **Video** | Anything about filming, camera settings, footage, editing |
| **Documentation** | Technical reference docs — the "how to" posts meant to be revisited |

## Decision Rule

- **Is it a reference doc?** → Documentation
- **Is it about lifting?** → Training
- **Is it about camera/filming?** → Video

Pick one from each pair if both apply.
