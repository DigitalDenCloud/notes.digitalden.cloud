## Weekly Notes — What to Capture

Use this as a checklist when writing your weekly notes for the creatine study.

---

### Performance

- Did any lifts feel easier or harder than last week?
- Did I progress (add reps or weight) on any lift?
- Did I stall or regress on anything? Why?
- Did sets feel more repeatable?

---

### Recovery

- How did I feel between sessions?
- Any unusual soreness or fatigue?
- Did I recover faster than usual?
- How did Monday feel after Sunday football?

---

### Physical

- Any changes in bodyweight?
- Do I look or feel different (fullness, pump, water retention)?
- Any bloating or GI issues from creatine?

---

### Training Context

- How many sessions this week?
- Any missed sessions? Why?
- Sleep quality this week?
- Nutrition — did I hit 3 meals consistently?

---

### Creatine Specific

- Any side effects (bloating, cramps, stomach issues)?
- Noticing anything I'd attribute to creatine?
- Or nothing noticeable yet?

---

## Example Entry

```markdown
### Week 1
**Creatine phase:** Loading (20g/day)

**Notes:**
- 5 sessions completed
- Bench felt slightly easier — hit 110kg × 4 (up from × 3)
- No noticeable creatine side effects yet
- Slight water retention — weight up 0.5kg
- Sleep average 7.5 hours, felt recovered between sessions
- Missed Sunday football (frozen pitch) — extra rest day
```

## Keep It Short

You don't need to answer every question. Just capture:

1. What changed
2. What stayed the same
3. Anything worth remembering
