---

I am Turkish, and I have been cooking more Turkish recipes at home recently. Bulgur pilaf is one of the staples. Simple to make, genuinely nutritious, and a better option than rice for everyday eating.

This post documents three versions built on the same base: a vegetable pilaf, a lamb shoulder version that turns a side dish into a full meal, and a leaner chicken thigh version that captures extra flavour by building the base in the same pan.

## Why Bulgur

Bulgur is a whole grain made from cracked, parboiled wheat. It has been a staple in Turkish cooking for centuries and holds up well as a rice replacement for anyone tracking nutrition.

### Bulgur vs Rice vs Other Grains

| Nutrient (per 100g cooked) | Bulgur | White Rice | Brown Rice | Quinoa |
|---------------------------|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| Calories | ~83 kcal | ~130 kcal | ~112 kcal | ~120 kcal |
| Protein | ~3.1g | ~2.7g | ~2.6g | ~4.4g |
| Carbohydrates | ~18.6g | ~28.2g | ~23.5g | ~21.3g |
| Fibre | ~4.5g | ~0.4g | ~1.8g | ~2.8g |
| Glycaemic Index | ~48 | ~73 | ~68 | ~53 |

The numbers that matter most are fibre and glycaemic index. Bulgur has more fibre than white rice, brown rice, and quinoa, and a lower GI than all three. That means slower digestion, steadier blood sugar, and better satiety per gram of carbohydrate.

For a performance diet built around training, that is a meaningful difference from white rice. It also cooks faster than brown rice and has more flavour on its own.

## The Base Recipe

All three batches use the same bulgur base. Batch 2 adds pan-seared lamb shoulder. Batch 3 adds pan-seared chicken thigh and builds the aromatic base in the chicken pan to capture the fond.

I use the following Turkish brands for all three core ingredients — the pepper paste in particular makes a difference to the flavour:

## Batch 1 — Vegetable Bulgur Pilaf

### Ingredients (4 servings)

| Ingredient | Brand / Source | Amount |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Coarse bulgur | Bodrum pilavlık | 360g |
| Extra virgin olive oil | — | 30g (2 tbsp) |
| Butter | — | 30g (2 tbsp, divided) |
| Onion | — | 1 medium (~120g), finely chopped |
| Garlic | — | 1 clove (~5g), minced |
| Turkish green chilies | — | 3 (~60–70g), finely chopped |
| Turkish sweet red pepper | — | 1 (~100g), chopped |
| Fresh tomatoes, grated | — | 3 medium (~220–240g pulp) |
| Tomato paste | Bodrum | 20g (1 tbsp) |
| Pepper paste (biber salçası) | Bodrum | 20g (1 tbsp) |
| Salt | — | 12g (2 tsp) |
| Dried mint | — | 4g (2 tsp) |
| Black pepper | — | 2g (1 tsp) |
| Chili flakes | — | 2g (1 tsp) |
| Hot water | — | 850ml |

> **Checking your chilies before cooking**  
> Turkish peppers can vary in heat even within the same batch. Before adding them to the pan, cut a small piece from the tip and touch it to your tongue. You will know within seconds whether it carries heat. As a general rule, longer and thinner peppers tend to be hotter while wider and blockier ones tend to be sweeter. If a pepper is hotter than expected, use fewer or remove the seeds and inner membranes, which is where most of the heat sits.

### Method

#### Step 1: Aromatic base

Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pan with a lid over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 3–4 minutes until translucent. Add 1 tbsp butter and let it lightly brown — not dark. Add garlic, green chilies, and red pepper and cook until softened.

#### Step 2: Tomato and spice layer

Add the tomato paste and pepper paste. Cook for 1–2 minutes to remove the raw flavour. Grate 3 medium tomatoes directly into the pan — this gives approximately 220–240g of fresh tomato pulp and replaces jarred tomato sauce entirely. Add the salt, dried mint, black pepper, and chili flakes. Stir briefly to combine.

#### Step 3: Toast the bulgur

Add the bulgur and stir for 3–4 minutes until the grains are coated in the fat and flavour base.

> **Why toast the bulgur**  
> Toasting before adding liquid improves grain separation and prevents mushiness. It also deepens the flavour slightly.
{: .prompt-info }

#### Step 4: Liquid and cook

Add 850ml hot water and stir once. Add the remaining 1 tbsp butter. Bring to a boil, then reduce to the lowest heat setting and cover fully. Simmer for 12–15 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.

#### Step 5: Rest

Turn off the heat. Lift the lid, fluff gently with a fork, then place a folded paper towel between the pan and lid. Rest for 10 minutes.

> **Why the paper towel**  
> It absorbs steam that would otherwise condense and drip back onto the grains. The result is a drier, fluffier texture.

## Batch 2 — Bulgur with Pan-Seared Lamb Shoulder

The bulgur method is identical to Batch 1. The lamb is cooked separately and folded in after both components have rested. This turns the pilaf from a side dish into a complete meal.

---

### Lamb Shoulder

I used half a lamb shoulder from my local butcher, which gave me approximately 1kg boneless after prep, diced into 2–3cm cubes.

#### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Source | Amount |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Boneless lamb shoulder | Local butcher | ~1kg, diced |
| Salt | — | 12g (2 tsp) |
| Black pepper | — | 1½ tsp |
| Paprika | — | 1½ tsp |
| Extra virgin olive oil | — | 15ml (1 tbsp) |

No wet marinade. A wet marinade prevents the surface from searing properly.

#### Method

Heat a stainless steel pan over medium-high heat before adding oil. Cook the lamb in batches — overcrowding the pan causes the meat to steam rather than sear. Leave each piece undisturbed for around 2 minutes, turn once, and cook for 5–6 minutes total per batch. You want a brown crust outside and a slight pink interior. Remove from heat and rest for 5 minutes before combining.

> **Why batch cooking matters here**  
> One kilo of lamb diced releases a lot of moisture. If you add it all at once, the pan temperature drops and the meat steams. Two or three batches keeps the pan hot and produces the crust you are after.

### Combining

Once both components have rested, add the lamb to the bulgur and fold gently with a fork. Cover and rest for a further 3–5 minutes.

### Nutrition — Batch 2 (per serving, 4 servings)

| Macro | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Calories | ~1,050–1,100 kcal |
| Protein | ~55–60g |
| Carbohydrates | ~65g |
| Fat | ~45–50g |

### Observations

| Attribute | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Texture | Richer, meat-integrated |
| Protein density | High — ~55–60g per serving |
| Flavour | Balanced fat, spice, and grain |
| Yield | 4 servings — 1 eaten fresh, 3 portioned into containers |

## Batch 3 — Bulgur with Pan-Seared Chicken Thigh

The bulgur method is identical to Batch 1. The chicken is seared first, and the aromatic base is built in the same pan to capture the fond. This produces a leaner alternative to the lamb version while keeping the protein density high enough for a recovery meal.

---

### Why Chicken Thigh Over Breast

Thigh has more fat and connective tissue, which means it stays moist after searing and holds up when folded into the bulgur. Breast dries out fast, especially diced and cooked at high heat. It tightens up and goes chewy sitting in containers over the week. Thigh gives better texture, better flavour, and better meal prep durability. The protein difference is small — thigh is around 26g per 100g raw versus breast at around 31g. Not enough to justify the texture tradeoff.

### Chicken Thigh

I used approximately 1kg boneless skinless chicken thighs, diced into 2–3cm cubes.

#### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Source | Amount |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Boneless skinless chicken thighs | Local butcher | ~1kg, diced |
| Salt | — | 12g (2 tsp) |
| Black pepper | — | 1¼ tsp |
| Pul biber (chili flakes) | — | 1¼ tsp |
| Cumin | — | 1¼ tsp |
| Sumac | — | 1¼ tsp |
| Paprika | — | 1¼ tsp |
| Extra virgin olive oil | — | 20ml (1½ tbsp) |

No wet marinade. Toss the cubes in the spices and oil to coat evenly and cook straight away. The sumac and cumin together give a southeastern Turkish profile that complements the pepper paste in the bulgur base.

#### Method

Heat a stainless steel pan over medium-high heat before adding oil. Cook the chicken in 2–3 batches — the same principle as the lamb. Place the cubes down and leave undisturbed for about 2 minutes until you get colour on the bottom. Turn once and cook for another 3–4 minutes. Chicken thighs are thinner than lamb shoulder so they cook faster. You want a brown crust outside and no pink inside. Set the chicken aside and keep covered.

> **Why batch cooking matters here**  
> The same logic as the lamb applies. One kilo of diced chicken added at once drops the pan temperature and causes steaming instead of searing. Two or three batches keeps the pan hot and produces the crust you are after.
{: .prompt-tip }

If you see black bits on the pan, they are burnt protein and spice, which will carry bitterness through the bulgur base. If dark spots are forming, deglaze with a tiny splash of water and scrape before the next batch. Add approximately 1 tsp of oil between batches and let it heat for about 10 seconds before adding the next batch — cold oil causes sticking and more burning.

---

### Building the Base in the Chicken Pan

Do not wash the pan after searing the chicken. The fond on the bottom carries flavour that the bulgur will absorb through the aromatic base.

#### Step 1: Aromatic base

Add the olive oil and 1 tbsp butter to the same pan. Cook the onion for 3–4 minutes until translucent. The moisture from the onion will deglaze the fond. Add garlic, green chilies, and red pepper and cook until softened.

#### Step 2: Tomato and spice layer

Add the tomato paste and pepper paste. Cook for 1–2 minutes. Grate 3 medium tomatoes directly into the pan. Add salt, dried mint, black pepper, and chili flakes. Stir to combine.

#### Step 3: Transfer

Transfer the entire base to a pot.

> **Check the fond before starting**  
> After searing the chicken, look at the pan. If there are dark burnt bits rather than golden brown fond, wipe those out before starting the onions. You want caramelised, not bitter.
{: .prompt-info }

#### Step 4: Toast the bulgur

Add the bulgur to the pot and stir for 3–4 minutes until the grains are coated.

#### Step 5: Liquid and cook

Add 850ml hot water and the remaining 1 tbsp butter. Bring to a boil, reduce to the lowest heat setting, and cover fully. Simmer for 12–15 minutes without lifting the lid.

#### Step 6: Rest

Turn off the heat. Fluff gently with a fork, then place a folded paper towel between the pot and lid. Rest for 10 minutes.

### Portioning

Once the chicken is mixed into the bulgur, it is difficult to estimate how much protein is in each container. The better approach is to weigh the components separately before combining.

1. Weigh the cooked chicken total after searing and resting, before folding in. With 1kg raw boneless thigh, expect roughly 750–800g cooked.
2. Divide into 4 equal portions by weight — roughly 190–200g cooked chicken per serving.
3. Weigh the bulgur separately and divide into 4.
4. Combine each chicken portion with each bulgur portion into containers.

This way you know exactly what is in each box.

> **Why weigh separately**  
> Around 190–200g cooked thigh gives roughly 48–52g protein from the chicken alone, plus another 10g from the bulgur. That puts each serving at about 58–62g total protein. Once mixed, you are guessing.
{: .prompt-info }

---

### Combining

Fold the chicken into the bulgur and mix gently with a fork. If portioning for meal prep, weigh the chicken and bulgur separately and combine per container as described above. If the chicken has cooled during the bulgur cook time, add it back during the last 3–4 minutes of the simmer so it reheats without overcooking. Cover and rest for a further 3–5 minutes.

### Nutrition — Batch 3 (per serving, 4 servings)

| Macro | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Calories | ~780–820 kcal |
| Protein | ~58–62g |
| Carbohydrates | ~65g |
| Fat | ~22–26g |
| Fibre | ~9g |

---

### Observations

| Attribute | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Texture | Lighter than lamb, well-integrated |
| Protein density | High — ~58–62g per serving |
| Flavour | Fond carries chicken flavour into the grain. Sumac and cumin lift the profile. |
| Fat content | Leaner than the lamb version by a significant margin |
| Yield | 4 servings — 1 eaten fresh, 3 portioned into containers |

## Summary

| Component | Batch 1 | Batch 2 | Batch 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Base | Vegetable bulgur pilaf | Same | Same |
| Protein source | — | ~1kg lamb shoulder | ~1kg chicken thigh |
| Calories per serving | ~450 kcal | ~1,050–1,100 kcal | ~780–820 kcal |
| Protein per serving | ~10g | ~55–60g | ~58–62g |
| Use case | Side dish or light meal | Full recovery meal | Leaner recovery meal |

Batch 1 works as a side or a lighter meal. Batch 2 is built around the lamb, high protein, filling, and practical for meal prep across the week. Batch 3 sits between the two. Leaner than lamb but still a solid recovery meal, with the fond method adding depth that chicken would otherwise lack.
