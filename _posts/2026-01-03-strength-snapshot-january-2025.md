## Introduction

This post is a snapshot. A record of where I am physically in January 2025.

I'm 35 years old, weighing 78kg, and I'm in the best shape and strongest I've been. Over the past year, I significantly improved my diet, stayed consistent with training, and hit multiple lifetime personal records. I don't know how long this lasts. I don't know if I'll be hitting these numbers at 40. So I'm documenting it now, while I'm in it.

This isn't a transformation story or a programme review. It's a physical inventory — every lift tested, every number recorded, captured across one week of training in early January 2025.

---

## For the Archive

I'm building an archive. Here's why.

1. **I have the tools now**  
   I've been learning photography and videography over the past year. I own a Sony A6700 and I've figured out how to film training in a low-light gym. Might as well use it.

2. **This might be peak**  
   At 35, I'm realistic. Bodies change. Strength doesn't last forever. If this is the strongest I'll ever be, I want it on record.

3. **It's for me, not for views**  
   I have a YouTube channel that started as AWS content for my job. It's evolving into something more personal — training, interests, things I enjoy. I upload the footage, share it with friends, and move on. If views come, fine. If not, the archive still exists.

4. **I can look back**  
   Whether I'm still hitting these numbers in five years or I'm watching old footage wondering how I did it, this record will exist.

## The Week — Daily Training Journal

A week of training captured in detail — the sessions, the context, the unfiltered version.

---

### Monday 29 December — Back Day

**The session**

| Exercise | Performance | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Bent over barbell row | 100kg × 10, 110kg × 3 | Felt heavier than usual |
| Lat pull ups | 20 reps (full stretch) | To failure |
| Single arm dumbbell row | 50kg × 10 | Heaviest dumbbell in gym |
| Rows (endurance) | 60kg × 43 | Volume work |
| Press ups | 72 (nose to floor) | To failure |
| Dips | 54 | To failure |

**Context**

- **Sleep & Recovery**
  - 10:00 PM – 5:00 AM (7 hours). Natural wake, good quality.
  - Recovery rating: 3.5/5. Mild pec soreness from chest two days prior.

- **Nutrition**
  - Only 2 meals day before. Skipped usual post-breakfast protein meal.
  - Breakfast: 4 eggs, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, 1 slice sourdough.
  - Dinner: 350g beef fillet marinated in teriyaki with whole fried onion at 7pm.
  - GI issues: Stomach cramps after morning coffee. Resolved by afternoon. Won't be cooking steak with a whole onion again.

- **Training**
  - 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM. Fasted as usual.
  - Caffeine: Filter coffee (12g) at 6am, flat white at 8am.

**How it felt**

Pull ups and rows felt heavier than usual despite similar numbers. Woke earlier than normal and felt hungrier going in. The combination of underfuelling, GI discomfort, and mild soreness made everything feel harder than it should.

Objectively a decent session. Subjectively, not my strongest.

**Filming**

First time recording training with the Sony A6700 in a gym setting. Used a tripod. Shot in 4K, Cinetone, white balance at 3000K for that industrial grey look. The kit lens (18-135mm f/3.5-4.5) struggled in low light — ISO was 2000+ to maintain 1/50 shutter speed.

Didn't feel self-conscious filming. Especially walking around with a tripod. Looking back at the 43-rep row footage was motivating.

**Rotator cuff**

30 minutes of stretching and rehab work before the session. Working on teres minor and external rotation. I've had this injury for three years. Only recently realised how limited my mobility had become. Doctor referred me for an ultrasound — still waiting. Whatever they say, I won't do surgery or steroid injections. If the whole point of training is building and fixing the body, I should be able to rehab this myself.

### Tuesday 30 December — Chest Day

**The session**

| Exercise | Performance | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Barbell bench press | 100kg × 8, 120kg × 1 | 130kg didn't move |
| Incline dumbbell press | 40kg × 6 (2 sets) | Below usual capacity |
| Superset: flat bench, incline bench, press ups | — | Good pump |

**Context**

- **Sleep & Recovery**
  - 11:00 PM – 5:00 AM, back to sleep, up at 6:30 AM (~7.5 hours). Natural wake, good quality.
  - Recovery rating: 4/5. Slight back soreness from Monday.

- **Nutrition**
  - Again only 2 meals day before. Same breakfast.
  - Dinner: 300g beef mince as smash burgers, 2 brioche buns, half onion. Dark chocolate and a glass of kefir.

- **Training**
  - 7:30 AM – 9:00 AM. Fasted.
  - Caffeine: Filter coffee (12g) at 6:30 AM.

**How it felt**

Bench felt harder than usual. Previous week I hit 100kg × 9 and have done 130kg × 1. Today 130kg didn't move. The 120kg single was there but heavy.

Two days of only 2 meals is showing up in the numbers. Session rating: 3.5-4/5.

**Filming**

Made a mistake — camera was set to photo mode instead of movie mode. Used camera settings to film instead of my movie preset. Didn't notice until the end. But the last exercise looked good because daylight was coming in around 9am. When natural light hits, ISO drops and everything looks cleaner.

**Other notes**

Dropped my camera in the car park on the way out. Concrete. Frustrating. Checked it multiple times — not a single scratch. The Peak Design mount on the bottom must have taken the impact.

### Wednesday 31 January — Legs Day

**The session**

| Exercise | Performance | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Squat | 120kg × 6 (nice depth), 130kg × 4 | Hit targets |
| Deadlift | 140kg × 7, 160kg × 3 | Grip went. Could have had 160kg × 4. |
| Hack squat | — | Untracked volume |
| Front squat | — | Untracked volume |
| Leg press | — | Untracked volume |
| Lunges (kettlebell) | — | Untracked volume |
| Calf raises | — | Untracked volume |
| Sprints | — | Conditioning |

**Context**

- **Sleep & Recovery**
  - 11:00 PM – 7:00 AM (8 hours). Good quality.
  - Recovery rating: 4/5. Slight soreness from chest and back but cleared once warm.

- **Nutrition**
  - 3 meals day before. The difference was noticeable.
  - Breakfast: Usual.
  - Lunch: 300g beef mince smash burger, 1 brioche bun, half onion.
  - Dinner: Bulgur with chicken. Some dark chocolate.

- **Training**
  - 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM (~1.5 hours solid plus filming). Fasted.
  - Caffeine: Usual filter coffee.

**How it felt**

Best session of the week so far. The extra meal made a noticeable difference — more energy, lifts felt smoother. Squats and deadlifts both hit targets. Overall session rating: 4.5/5.

> **The nutrition pattern**  
> Two meals is not enough. Every session after a 2-meal day felt flat. Every session after 3 meals felt strong.
{: .prompt-info }

**Filming**

Very happy with the content. But noticed an issue: during squats in the rack against the wall, ISO was fluctuating. The footage would go bright then normal, even though nothing changed. Realised the camera was in aperture priority with auto ISO — it was hunting as I moved in and out of shadows.

### Thursday 1 January — Shoulders Day

**The session**

| Exercise | Performance | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Standing shoulder press | 60kg × 6, 70kg × 3 | That third rep at 70kg was a battle. Happy with it. |
| Incline dumbbell press | 50kg × 2, 46kg × 5 | 50kg is there for 2 reps. Have done 50kg × 5 on flat previously — incline is much harder. |
| Side raises | — | Untracked |
| Rear delts | — | Untracked |

**Context**

- **Sleep & Recovery**
  - 12:15 AM – 8:00 AM (~7.75 hours). Good quality.
  - Recovery rating: 4/5. Glutes and hamstrings sore from legs.

- **Nutrition**
  - 4 eating occasions day before (New Year's Eve) — most fuelled day of the week.
  - Breakfast: Usual.
  - Lunch: 300g beef fillet, asparagus, 1 potato.
  - Out: Turkish cake.
  - Night: Pastrami cheese sandwich.

- **Training**
  - 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM. Fasted.
  - Caffeine: Filter coffee + flat white.

**How it felt**

Felt more fuelled. The 70kg shoulder press third rep was a grind but I got it. Overall session rating: 4/5.

**Filming — breakthrough**

Fixed the ISO hunting problem. Switched to full manual: locked ISO at 1000, aperture at f/4, shutter at 1/50. Checked histogram — well spread, no clipping. Set zebras to 100.

Best video yet. Daylight was coming into the gym. Manual exposure + locked ISO + natural light = solved.

**Rotator cuff**

30 minutes of stretching and rehab before session, as every day this week. Working on teres minor and external rotation. The consistent mobility work is helping.

---

### Friday 2 January — Rest Day

**Planned:** Arms + secondary indicators retest.

**Actual:** Rest day. Body needed it.

**Context**

- **Sleep & Recovery**
  - 11:30 PM – 8:00 AM (8.5 hours). Very good quality. Natural wake.
  - Soreness: Legs mild in morning, cleared.

- **Nutrition**
  - 3 solid meals.
  - Breakfast: Usual + 2 sourdough.
  - Lunch: 300g steak, asparagus, spinach.
  - Dinner: Turkish fasulye, rice, Greek yoghurt with blueberries.

- **Activity**
  - 10k walk. Very cold — 1°C.

Four training days in a row. Legs Wednesday, shoulders Thursday. Taking Friday off was the right call.

---

### Saturday 3 January — Full Session (Best of the Week)

**The session**

| Exercise | Performance | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Bench press | 100kg × 9, 110kg × 3 | Solid |
| Squat | 140kg × 2, 120kg × 8 | |
| Deadlift | 140kg × 7, 180kg × 1, 190kg × 1 | **190kg PB at 78kg bodyweight** |
| Lat pull ups | 20 reps | Felt better than Monday |
| Press ups | 80 (nose to floor) | New best |
| Nordic curls | 8 reps × 3 sets | Slow and controlled. Great stretch. See footballers do this — as someone who plays a lot, it feels great. |
| Bicep curls | 20kg × 6, 25kg × 1 | |
| Skull crushers | 20kg × 2 | |
| Sprints | 3 sets | Conditioning |

**Context**

- **Sleep & Recovery**
  - 10:30 PM – 6:00 AM (7.5 hours). Very good quality.
  - Recovery rating: 4.5/5. Tiny bit of soreness, nothing specific.

- **Nutrition**
  - 3 meals day before, well fuelled. Two good eating days in a row.

- **Training**
  - 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM. Fasted.
  - Caffeine: Usual.

**How it felt**

Best session of the week. The Friday rest day and two consecutive days of 3 meals — I felt it. Session rating: 4.5/5.

Between squats and deadlifts it was intense. Not much rest, just banged it out. Squats: 140kg × 2, down to 120kg × 8, down to 100kg × 10. Then straight into deadlifts: 60kg × 10, 100kg × 10, 140kg × 7, 180kg × 1, 190kg × 1.

> **The 190kg deadlift**  
> Personal best at this bodyweight. 190kg at 78kg is a 2.44× bodyweight pull. And I did it after squats and volume deadlifts — not fresh.
{: .prompt-tip }

My training partner couldn't get the 190kg. He's usually stronger at deadlift than me. But he had no belt and only slept 4 hours (wife and kid). Sleep and recovery showing up in the data again.

**Filming**

Made one adjustment: dropped shutter speed from 1/50 to 1/25 to allow lower ISO. Was worried about motion blur. Tested it — fine on all the important lifts. Only noticeable on fast press ups. Worth the trade-off for cleaner footage at ISO 640-800.

Recorded a 20-minute video covering the entire squat and deadlift progression. It looks good. Uploading straight to YouTube.

**Rotator cuff**

30 minutes stretching and rehab before session. Every day this week. The consistency is paying off.

## What Affected Performance

Looking at the week as a whole, a few patterns are clear.

### Nutrition

| Day | Meals Day Before | Session Rating | Notes |
|-----|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Monday | 2 | 3.5 | Rows felt heavy |
| Tuesday | 2 | 3.5-4 | Bench below previous week |
| Wednesday | 3 | 4.5 | Hit targets |
| Thursday | 4 | 4 | Best fuelled going in |
| Saturday | 3 | 4.5 | PB deadlift |

Two meals is not enough. Three meals minimum. When I ate more, I performed better.

### Sleep

Every night was 7-8.5 hours. Always natural wake — I don't use alarms. Sleep quality was consistently good. This is non-negotiable for me.

### Recovery

Taking Friday as a rest day after four consecutive training days made Saturday's session possible. I went in with 2 days of good eating and a full rest day behind me. That's when the PB happened.

### The Rotator Cuff

I've been dealing with a rotator cuff injury for three years. Only recently realised how bad the mobility limitation had become. This week, I did 30 minutes of stretching and rehab work before every session — working on teres minor, external rotation, shoulder mobility.

Doctor referred me for an ultrasound. Still waiting. Whatever they recommend — surgery, steroid injections — I'm not interested. The whole point of training is building and fixing the body. I should be able to rehab this myself. And it's improving.

---

## The Filming Side

This week was also about learning to film training properly.

### The Setup

- **Camera:** Sony A6700
- **Lens:** Sony 18-135mm f/3.5-4.5 (kit lens)
- **Picture profile:** Cinetone
- **White balance:** 3000K (industrial grey aesthetic)

### The Problem

Low-light gym. Kit lens only opens to f/3.5-4.5. To maintain 1/50 shutter speed, ISO was hitting 2000+. Footage was noisy. And in aperture priority mode, ISO was hunting — fluctuating mid-shot as I moved in and out of shadows.

### The Fix

Switched to full manual:
- Aperture: f/4 (wide as the lens allows)
- Shutter: 1/25 (dropped from 1/50 — motion blur acceptable on lifting movements)
- ISO: 640-800 (locked manually)
- Zebras: Set to 100 to check for clipping
- Histogram: Monitored to avoid underexposure

Result: Consistent exposure, no hunting, cleaner footage. The daylight window around 9am makes a significant difference — ISO can drop to 1000 or below.

### The Footage

The Saturday session produced a 20-minute video covering squats and deadlifts. 140kg × 2 squats down to 120kg × 8 down to 100kg × 10, then deadlifts from 60kg up to the 190kg PB.

## What's Next

This snapshot marks the end of baseline week. Starting Monday 6 January, I begin a 12-week creatine supplementation study:

- **Loading phase:** 20g per day (5g × 4) for 7 days
- **Maintenance phase:** 5g per day for the remaining weeks

The same lifts will be tested again at the end of the 12 weeks. The goal is to see whether creatine meaningfully supports progressive overload when foundational habits — sleep, nutrition, consistency — are already in place.

> **Follow the study**
