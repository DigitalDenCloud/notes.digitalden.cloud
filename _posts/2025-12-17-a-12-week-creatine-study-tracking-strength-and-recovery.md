## Introduction

On 5 January 2026, I began a 12 week self-study to track the impact of creatine supplementation on strength training performance and recovery.

This post is a living document. It captures the protocol, baseline measurements, and is updated weekly as the study progresses.

I'm not expecting dramatic changes. Over the past year, improvements in diet, consistency, and recovery have already produced significant strength gains at a stable bodyweight of 78kg. This is the strongest I've been. The question is whether creatine supports continued progression when the fundamentals are already in place.

## The Protocol

**Supplement:** Creatine Monohydrate from [Nutrition Geeks](https://www.nutritiongeeks.co/products/pure-creatine-monohydrate){:target="_blank"} — single ingredient, no additives.

![Creatine Monohydrate](/assets/img/posts/pure-creatine-monohydrate-powder-nutrition-geeks.webp){: .w-50 .left }

**Loading phase**
- 20 grams per day (5g × 4)
- Duration: 7 days

**Maintenance phase**
- 5 grams per day
- Duration: Remaining 11 weeks

Timing is not treated as a variable. Daily intake is prioritised over specific timing relative to training.

## Prior Creatine Use

Earlier in the year, I supplemented with approximately 3.5g of creatine per day for around 90 days. During that period, I achieved several lifetime personal records.

I then stopped supplementing. By the start of this study, I had been off creatine for approximately six weeks — enough time for muscle creatine levels to return close to baseline.

This study exists to test whether those earlier gains can be reproduced and documented under structured conditions.

## What I'm Tracking

### Primary Lifts

Six compound movements, each with a defined rep range:

| Lift | Rep Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Barbell bench press | 4–6 | |
| Bent over barbell row | 6–8 | |
| Standing shoulder press | 3–6 | |
| Squat | 3–5 | |
| Deadlift | 2–5 | Chalk and alternate grip |
| Weighted pull ups | 4–6 | Wide grip, full stretch |

For each lift, one top working set (the heaviest set within the rep range) is recorded, pushed to or near failure.

### Secondary Indicators

Bodyweight movements performed to technical failure, once per week:

| Exercise | Standard |
|----------|----------|
| Press ups | Nose to floor |
| Pull ups | Wide grip, full stretch |
| Dips | Bodyweight |

### Other Metrics

| Metric | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Bodyweight | Weekly (morning, fasted) |
| Recovery rating (1–5) | Weekly |
| Contextual notes | As needed |

---

## Week 0 — Baseline

Baseline testing completed across a training week prior to starting creatine. Full context documented in [Strength Snapshot — January 2026](https://notes.digitalden.cloud/posts/strength-snapshot-january-2026/){:target="_blank"}.

### Primary Strength Metrics

| Lift | Top Working Set | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Barbell bench press | 110kg × 3 | Within 4–6 rep range |
| Bent over barbell row | 110kg × 5 | Grip limited. Within 6–8 rep range. |
| Standing shoulder press | 70kg × 3 | Within 3–6 rep range. Third rep was a grind. |
| Squat | 130kg × 4 | Within 3–5 rep range |
| Deadlift | 160kg × 3 | Within 2–5 rep range |
| Weighted pull ups | TBD | Baseline to be tested Week 1 |

### Secondary Performance Indicators

| Exercise | Repetitions | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Press ups | 80 | Nose to floor |
| Pull ups | 20 | Full stretch at bottom |
| Dips | 54 | Bodyweight |

### Bodyweight and Recovery

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Bodyweight | 78kg | Stable for several months |
| Recovery rating | 4/5 | Average across baseline week |

### Baseline Notes

- Early sessions affected by underfuelling (2-meal days)
- Best performances came after rest day and consecutive 3-meal days
- 190kg deadlift PB achieved during baseline week (outside tracked rep range)
- 30 minutes rotator cuff rehab performed before each session

> **Baseline context**  
> These values represent typical training performance under normal conditions, not maximal effort or peak performance.

## Why These Rep Ranges

Rep ranges are lift-specific rather than standardised. Each reflects the movement's demands:

**Lower body (squats, deadlifts)** — Lower rep ranges. These lifts impose significant systemic fatigue. Heavier loading with fewer reps reduces fatigue accumulation and technical breakdown.

**Upper body pressing (bench, shoulder press)** — Moderate rep ranges. These respond well to heavier loading while allowing enough volume for progression signals.

**Rows** — Higher rep range. Preserves technical consistency and limits lower back fatigue under load.

This approach balances load intensity, fatigue management, and the ability to detect meaningful changes over time.

---

## What Counts as a Tracked Set

For each lift, only one set per week is recorded: the best qualifying set within the defined rep range.

> **Example**  
> If bench press sets are:  
> - 100kg × 6  
> - 105kg × 4  
> - 110kg × 3  
>  
> Only **105kg × 4** is recorded — the heaviest set within the 4–6 rep range.
{: .prompt-tip }

Progression is attempted when performance allows, not enforced on a fixed schedule. Holding performance under fatigue counts as a valid outcome.

---

## Lifestyle Context

These factors reflect my normal routine. Nothing was changed for the study.

### Training

- 5–6 sessions per week
- Morning training (typically 7:00–9:00)
- 60–90 minutes per session
- Fasted, with filter coffee beforehand
- Organised around movement patterns, not a fixed split

### Recovery

- ~8 hours sleep per night
- ~10,000 steps daily
- Sunday league football (90 mins, high intensity)
- Mondays typically rest days

### Nutrition

- ~150g protein per day (~1.9g per kg bodyweight)
- Moderate carbohydrates, minimal added sugar
- No alcohol
- 3 meals minimum (learned during baseline week that 2 meals affects performance)

### Other Supplements

These are part of my existing routine and unchanged during the study:

- Magnesium
- Vitamin D
- Omega 3
- Vitamin B12
- Zinc
- Lion's Mane
- Turmeric

## What I Expect

Creatine is not expected to override fatigue or force personal records.

The potential value lies in:
- Improved repeatability of heavy sets
- Better tolerance to training stress
- Fewer stalled sessions
- Supporting recovery between sessions

If creatine does nothing measurable, that's a valid finding. The goal is to document what actually happens, not to prove a predetermined conclusion.
