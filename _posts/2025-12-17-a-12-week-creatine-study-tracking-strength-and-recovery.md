## Introduction

On 1 January 2025, I will begin a 12 week self study to track the impact of creatine supplementation on strength training performance and recovery.

Creatine is one of the most extensively researched supplements in resistance training, yet much of the discussion around it relies on short term anecdotes or exaggerated claims. Rather than writing a one off review, this post is designed as a living journal that will be updated weekly as the study progresses.

This study focuses on tracking measurable performance outcomes under normal training conditions, with the aim of understanding whether creatine meaningfully contributes to strength progression when foundational habits are already consistent.

### Study Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate whether creatine supplementation produces a measurable improvement in strength performance and recovery within the context of an already consistent training and lifestyle setup.

Specifically, this study aims to:

- Assess changes in strength output across a fixed set of compound lifts.
- Evaluate whether creatine supports sustained progressive overload under normal training conditions.
- Observe whether personal best performances are achieved more frequently or more consistently during the study period.
- Observe any changes in perceived recovery between training sessions.
- Distinguish measurable performance changes from subjective impressions.

To support these objectives, training structure, nutrition habits, sleep patterns, and lifestyle factors are kept stable throughout the study period.

### Prior Creatine Use and Rationale

Earlier in the year, I supplemented with a low daily dose of creatine at approximately 3.5 grams per day for around 90 days. During that period, I achieved several lifetime personal records across compound lifts, and overall strength progression felt consistently strong.

Creatine supplementation was then discontinued, and by the official start of this study I had been off creatine for approximately four weeks. This washout period is intended to allow muscle creatine levels to return close to baseline before reintroducing supplementation under a structured protocol.

The combination of previously observed strength improvements and the subsequent break from creatine prompted this study. Rather than relying on memory or perception, the aim is to systematically reintroduce creatine under controlled conditions and objectively track whether similar strength and recovery benefits reappear over a defined 12 week period.

This study exists to test whether those earlier gains can be reproduced, measured, and documented in a structured and transparent way.

### Supplement Protocol


This study uses standard Creatine Monohydrate sourced from [Nutrition Geeks.](https://www.nutritiongeeks.co/products/pure-creatine-monohydrate){:target="_blank"} The product contains a single ingredient, creatine monohydrate, with no added flavours, sweeteners, or fillers. No alternative creatine forms are used during the study.

Creatine supplementation is commonly divided into two phases: a loading phase and a maintenance phase. The loading phase is intended to rapidly increase muscle creatine stores, while the maintenance phase aims to sustain those levels once saturation has been reached.

{: .clearfix }

**Loading phase**
- 20 grams per day
- Taken as 5 grams four times daily
- Duration of seven days

**Maintenance phase**
- 5 grams per day
- Duration of the remaining study period

Creatine timing is not treated as a variable. Daily intake is prioritised over specific timing relative to training.

### Training and Baseline Methodology

Before beginning the main study period, baseline performance is recorded across a fixed set of compound lifts using predefined rep ranges. These baseline values serve as reference points for evaluating strength progression over the 12 week period.

Baseline testing is performed across a five day training week using normal training sessions rather than a single maximal testing day. For each lift, one top working set is recorded within the assigned rep range at approximately RPE seven to eight, meaning each set is challenging but performed with a small margin of reps in reserve.

No one rep maximum testing is used.

No intentional changes are made to training volume, exercise selection, or progression strategy during the study period.

> **RPE definition**  
> In this context, RPE (rate of perceived exertion) refers to the estimated proximity to muscular failure. An RPE of seven to eight indicates that the set is challenging but completed with approximately two to three repetitions remaining in reserve.
{: .prompt-info }

Training follows a progressive overload approach, with progression attempted when performance allows rather than enforced on a fixed schedule.

### Tracked Lifts and Rep Ranges

The following compound barbell lifts are tracked consistently throughout the study.

The selected rep ranges reflect commonly used strength training practices and were chosen to balance load, technical consistency, and repeatability across the study period. These ranges are not based on current performance, but on established strength training principles.

- **Barbell bench press**  
  4 to 6 reps  

- **Bent over barbell row**  
  6 to 8 reps  

- **Standing barbell shoulder press**  
  3 to 6 reps  

- **Squat**  
  3 to 5 reps  

- **Deadlift**  
  2 to 5 reps  

---

### Rep Range Rationale

Rep ranges are not standardised across all lifts in this study. Instead, each lift is assigned a range that reflects its biomechanical demands, fatigue profile, and typical strength progression characteristics.

Lower body compound movements such as squats and deadlifts impose significant systemic and axial fatigue. For these lifts, lower rep ranges allow heavier loading while reducing excessive fatigue accumulation, technical breakdown, and recovery noise between sessions. This improves repeatability and makes changes in strength output easier to detect over time.

Upper body compound movements are distributed across slightly wider ranges based on their mechanical complexity and tolerance for volume. The bench press responds well to moderately heavy loading, while bent over rows are assigned a higher rep range to preserve technical consistency and limit lower back fatigue under load. The standing barbell shoulder press is kept in a lower rep range due to its high neurological demand and slower rate of progression.

These lift specific rep ranges are commonly used in strength focused training and were selected to balance:
- Load intensity  
- Technical consistency  
- Fatigue management  
- Sensitivity to performance changes  

Standardising all lifts to a single rep range would increase variability and reduce the ability to meaningfully track strength progression across movements with different fatigue and recovery characteristics.

By assigning rep ranges based on established training practice rather than current performance, the study aims to capture genuine changes in strength capacity rather than short term fluctuations or artefacts of fatigue.

### Set Selection and Tracking Rules

For each lift, a single top working set is recorded once per week. If a lift is performed multiple times within a week, only the best qualifying set within the defined rep range is used for tracking.

> **Example**  
> If multiple working sets are performed for the same lift in a session, only the highest qualifying set is recorded.  
>  
> For example, if the following bench press sets are completed in one session:  
> - 100 kg × 6 reps  
> - 105 kg × 4 reps  
> - 110 kg × 3 reps  
>  
> Only **105 kg × 4 reps** would be recorded as the top working set, as it is the heaviest set completed within the defined 4 to 6 rep range.
{: .prompt-tip }

For deadlifts, lifting straps are used on top working sets to prevent grip strength from limiting posterior chain performance and to ensure consistency across sessions.

Accessory exercises, additional volume, and secondary training days are not tracked as primary performance metrics.

### Secondary Performance Indicators

In addition to barbell lifts, a small set of bodyweight exercises are tracked as secondary indicators of upper body work capacity and recovery.

These movements are performed once per week for a single set to technical failure and are not treated as primary outcomes.

- **Press ups**  
- **Pull ups**  
- **Dips**  

Baseline performance prior to the study was approximately:
- Press ups: 100 reps  
- Pull ups: 20 reps  
- Dips: 50 reps  

These measures provide supporting context alongside primary strength outcomes but are not used to guide training decisions during the study.

### Tracking Approach

Training is logged daily in a private log. This post is updated weekly with summary data.

To keep tracking consistent and focused, the table below outlines the core metrics recorded each week and how they are used within the study.

### Weekly Tracking Summary

| Metric | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|------|
| Top working set per lift | Weekly | Best qualifying set within the defined rep range |
| Bodyweight | Weekly | Measured under consistent conditions |
| Recovery rating | Weekly | Subjective score from 1 to 5 |
| Contextual notes | As needed | Sleep, football sessions, unusual fatigue |

This approach prioritises weekly performance trends over session by session detail and is intended to minimise noise while preserving meaningful strength and recovery signals. Bodyweight is recorded once per week in the morning under consistent conditions to reduce short term fluctuations.


> **Why this works best**  
> - Hydration levels are most stable  
> - No food weight in the stomach  
> - No acute training related water shifts  
> - No caffeine related effects  
> - Most repeatable conditions week to week

### Lifestyle Context

This study is conducted within the context of my current lifestyle and normal training routine. These factors are not introduced specifically for the study and reflect how I typically train and live.

#### Diet context
- Diet quality is consistent, with no deliberate changes during the study period  
- Estimated protein intake averages around 150 g per day, which corresponds to approximately 1.9 g per kg of bodyweight (78 kg) and falls within a commonly recommended range for strength training  
- Carbohydrate intake is moderate and consistent, with minimal added sugar and most intake coming from whole food sources  
- Alcohol is not part of my routine  

#### Training context
- Training frequency typically ranges between five and six sessions per week  
- Sessions are usually performed in the morning  
- Training time is generally consistent, most commonly between 7:00 and 9:00, with occasional sessions between 9:00 and 11:00  
- Session duration typically ranges from one hour to one hour and thirty minutes  
- Training is organised around major movement patterns rather than a fixed weekly split  

#### Recovery and activity
- Bodyweight has been stable at approximately 78 kg for several months prior to the study  
- Average sleep duration is approximately eight hours per night  
- Daily activity averages around ten thousand steps  
- Football is played once per week as a high intensity 11 a side Sunday league match lasting approximately 90 minutes  
- Due to the intensity of this session, Mondays are typically taken as a recovery day 

#### Supplement background (non-variable)

In addition to creatine, the following supplements are part of my existing routine and are not introduced, removed, or adjusted for the purpose of this study.

- **Magnesium**  
  Supports normal muscle function and neuromuscular signalling.

- **Vitamin D**  
  Involved in bone health, immune function, and hormonal regulation.

- **Omega 3**  
  Contributes to cardiovascular health and normal inflammatory balance.

- **Vitamin B12**  
  Supports red blood cell formation and nervous system function.

- **Zinc**  
  Involved in immune function, hormone production, and cellular repair.

- **Lion’s mane**  
  Commonly used for cognitive support and nervous system health.

- **Turmeric**  
  Contains curcumin, which is associated with antioxidant and anti inflammatory activity.

These supplements are treated as background health support rather than performance variables and are kept consistent throughout the study period.

> **Training and caffeine context**  
> Training sessions are typically performed in a fasted state with a single filter coffee beforehand. Coffee intake is kept broadly consistent, with the first coffee prepared at home in the morning. Additional coffee consumption later in the day is not treated as a variable.
{: .prompt-info }

All lifestyle and training factors outlined in this section are intentionally kept stable to ensure that observed changes reflect typical training conditions rather than deliberate optimisation.

### Scope and Limitations

This is not a supplement endorsement. It is not a transformation narrative. It is not an attempt to optimise every training variable.

This post exists primarily as a personal performance log, designed to objectively track whether creatine supplementation contributes to increased strength and improved recovery over a 12 week period when foundational habits are already in place. Results reflect an individual response and are not intended to be generalised.

Weekly summaries will be added below as the study progresses.

> **Creatine expectations**  
> Creatine is not expected to override fatigue or guarantee progression, but may influence recovery, training consistency, and the frequency of successful progression opportunities.

## Week 0 — Baseline Performance

This section captures baseline performance prior to the start of creatine supplementation. All values recorded here serve as reference points for evaluating strength progression and recovery over the 12 week study period.

Baseline testing was completed across a five day training week using normal training sessions. For each tracked lift, one top working set within the defined rep range was recorded at approximately RPE seven to eight.

No creatine supplementation was used during baseline testing.

### Interpretation

This section captures a short, objective interpretation of the week’s data.

- Was progression achieved or attempted?  
- Did performance feel more repeatable compared to baseline?  
- Were there any noticeable recovery differences?  

Progression is attempted when performance allows rather than enforced on a fixed schedule. Holding performance under fatigue is treated as a valid outcome.
