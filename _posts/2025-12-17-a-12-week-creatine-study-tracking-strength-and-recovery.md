## Introduction

On 5 January 2026, I began a 12 week self-study to track the impact of creatine supplementation on strength training performance and recovery.

This post is a living document. It captures the protocol, baseline measurements, and is updated weekly as the study progresses.

I'm not expecting dramatic changes. Over the past year, improvements in diet, consistency, and recovery have already produced significant strength gains at a stable bodyweight of 78kg. This is the strongest I've been. The question is whether creatine supports continued progression when the fundamentals are already in place.

> **Scope**  
> This is not a supplement endorsement. Not a transformation narrative. Not an attempt to optimise every variable. It's a personal log tracking whether creatine makes a measurable difference under real-world conditions. Life continues—recovery sessions, travel days, Sunday football. When something deviates from routine, I note it. Otherwise, I train, eat, sleep, and document what happens.

## The Protocol

**Supplement:** Creatine Monohydrate from [Nutrition Geeks](https://www.nutritiongeeks.co/products/pure-creatine-monohydrate){:target="_blank"} — single ingredient, no additives.

![Creatine Monohydrate](/assets/img/posts/pure-creatine-monohydrate-powder-nutrition-geeks.webp){: .w-50 .left }

**Loading phase**
- 20 grams per day (5g × 4)
- Duration: 7 days

**Maintenance phase**
- 5 grams per day
- Duration: Remaining 11 weeks

Timing is not treated as a variable. Daily intake is prioritised over specific timing relative to training.

## Prior Creatine Use

Earlier in the year, I supplemented with approximately 3.5g of creatine per day for around 90 days. During that period, I achieved several lifetime personal records.

I then stopped supplementing. By the start of this study, I had been off creatine for approximately six weeks — enough time for muscle creatine levels to return close to baseline.

This study exists to test whether those earlier gains can be reproduced and documented under structured conditions.

## What I'm Tracking

### Primary Lifts

Six compound movements, each with a defined rep range:

| Lift | Rep Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Barbell bench press | 4–6 | |
| Bent over barbell row | 6–8 | |
| Standing shoulder press | 3–6 | |
| Squat | 3–5 | |
| Deadlift | 2–5 | Chalk and alternate grip |
| Weighted pull ups | 4–6 | Wide grip, full stretch |

For each lift, one top working set (the heaviest set within the rep range) is recorded, pushed to or near failure.

### Secondary Indicators

Bodyweight movements performed to technical failure, once per week:

| Exercise | Standard |
|----------|----------|
| Press ups | Nose to floor |
| Pull ups | Wide grip, full stretch |
| Dips | Bodyweight |

### Other Metrics

| Metric | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Bodyweight | Weekly (morning, fasted) |
| Recovery rating (1–5) | Weekly |
| Contextual notes | As needed |

---

## Week 0 — Baseline

Baseline testing completed across a training week prior to starting creatine. Full context documented in [Strength Snapshot — January 2026](https://notes.digitalden.cloud/posts/strength-snapshot-january-2026/){:target="_blank"}.

### Primary Strength Metrics

| Lift | Top Working Set | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Barbell bench press | 110kg × 3 | Within 4–6 rep range |
| Bent over barbell row | 110kg × 5 | Grip limited. Within 6–8 rep range. |
| Standing shoulder press | 70kg × 3 | Within 3–6 rep range. Third rep was a grind. |
| Squat | 130kg × 4 | Within 3–5 rep range |
| Deadlift | 160kg × 3 | Within 2–5 rep range |
| Weighted pull ups | 40kg × 3 | Within 4–6 rep range |

### Secondary Performance Indicators

| Exercise | Repetitions | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Press ups | 80 | Nose to floor |
| Pull ups | 20 | Full stretch at bottom |
| Dips | 54 | Bodyweight |

### Bodyweight and Recovery

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Bodyweight | 78kg | Stable for several months |
| Recovery rating | 4/5 | Average across baseline week |

### Baseline Notes

- Early sessions affected by underfuelling (2-meal days)
- Best performances came after rest day and consecutive 3-meal days
- 190kg deadlift PB achieved during baseline week (outside tracked rep range)
- 30 minutes rotator cuff rehab performed before each session

> **Baseline context**  
> These values represent typical training performance under normal conditions, not maximal effort or peak performance.
{: .prompt-info }

## Why These Rep Ranges
Rep ranges are lift-specific rather than standardised. Each reflects the movement's demands:

**Lower body (squats, deadlifts)** — Lower rep ranges. These lifts impose significant systemic fatigue. Heavier loading with fewer reps reduces fatigue accumulation and technical breakdown.

**Upper body pressing (bench, shoulder press)** — Moderate rep ranges. These respond well to heavier loading while allowing enough volume for progression signals.

**Rows** — Higher rep range. Preserves technical consistency and limits lower back fatigue under load.

This approach balances load intensity, fatigue management, and the ability to detect meaningful changes over time.

---

## What Counts as a Tracked Set

For each lift, only one set per week is recorded: the best qualifying set within the defined rep range.

> **Example**  
> If bench press sets are:  
> - 100kg × 6  
> - 105kg × 4  
> - 110kg × 3  
>  
> Only **105kg × 4** is recorded — the heaviest set within the 4–6 rep range.
{: .prompt-tip }

Progression is attempted when performance allows, not enforced on a fixed schedule. Holding performance under fatigue counts as a valid outcome.

---

## Testing Approach

Lifts are recorded when they occur naturally in training—not forced into every week to fill the table.

If a qualifying set happens (heaviest set within rep range), it gets logged. If a lift doesn't come up that week, the cell stays empty. Empty cells aren't gaps in the study—they're just weeks where that lift wasn't tested.

Dedicated testing weeks at **Week 6** (halfway) and **Week 12** (end) will hit all six primary lifts and three secondary indicators intentionally, mirroring the baseline week protocol. This gives three clean data points per lift (W0, W6, W12) plus any incidental progressions recorded along the way.

The goal is to track progression under normal training conditions, not to optimise the study at the expense of how I actually train.

---

## Lifestyle Context

These factors reflect my normal routine. Nothing was changed for the study.

### Training

- 5–6 sessions per week
- Morning training (typically 7:00–9:00)
- 60–90 minutes per session
- Fasted, with filter coffee beforehand
- Organised around movement patterns, not a fixed split

### Recovery

- ~8 hours sleep per night
- ~10,000 steps daily
- Sunday league football (90 mins, high intensity)
- Mondays typically rest days

### Nutrition

- ~150g protein per day (~1.9g per kg bodyweight)
- Moderate carbohydrates, minimal added sugar
- No alcohol
- 3 meals minimum (learned during baseline week that 2 meals affects performance)

### Other Supplements

These are part of my existing routine and unchanged during the study:
- Magnesium
- Vitamin D
- Omega 3
- Vitamin B12
- Zinc
- Lion's Mane
- Turmeric

---

## What I Expect

Creatine is not expected to override fatigue or force personal records.

The potential value lies in:
- Improved repeatability of heavy sets
- Better tolerance to training stress
- Fewer stalled sessions
- Supporting recovery between sessions

If creatine does nothing measurable, that's a valid finding. The goal is to document what actually happens, not to prove a predetermined conclusion.

> **The real question**  
> Does creatine meaningfully support progressive overload when sleep, nutrition, and consistency are already dialled in?

## Weekly Notes

### Week 1
**Creatine phase:** Loading (20g/day)

**Summary:**
- 6 training sessions completed (chest, back/recovery, legs, back, shoulders, legs)
- No strength or endurance improvements yet—still recovering from heavy baseline week where I pushed for PRs
- Noticeable pump/fullness from around day 5-6, likely water being pulled into muscle
- No difficulty taking 20g across 4 doses, no GI issues from creatine itself
- Sleep consistent all week (~7-8 hours, 11pm to 6-7am)
- Nutrition on track—3 meals daily
- Football Sunday: first match after a month off due to Christmas, felt good, legs tired after in cold conditions
- Weighted pull-ups baseline established: 40kg × 3 reps

**Bodyweight:** 79.3kg at start of week (up from 78kg baseline). Dropped to 79kg by start of Week 2 despite loading—possible factors include Sunday football, sauna, or individual response to creatine.

**Recovery:** 3.5/5 average

**Observations:**
- Wednesday leg session impacted by doing 3 sets of sprints on speed machine (hit 20mph each set) before training. Heart rate stayed elevated, took about an hour to feel normal again. Energy depleted for the entire session. Second time this has happened—avoid high-intensity cardio before lifting going forward.
- Spinach on empty stomach post-training causes discomfort—fine later in day. To be tested further.
- Monday rest day followed by sauna (20 mins), swim (10 laps), steam room (10 mins) for recovery before starting Week 2.

**Reflection:**
Going into Week 1, I wasn't sure what to expect from loading. Strength and endurance felt no different—if anything, I was weaker due to residual fatigue from baseline week. But the pump and fullness were noticeable by day 5-6. That's the first sign creatine is doing something, even if performance hasn't caught up yet.

Interestingly, two days into maintenance (5g/day), that pump feeling has faded. Could be the drop from 20g to 5g, could be coincidence, could be placebo wearing off. Worth watching over the coming weeks to see if it returns or stabilises.

---

### Week 2
**Creatine phase:** Maintenance (5g/day)

**Summary:**
- 5 training sessions completed (back, legs, chest, shoulders/back/deadlift, light arms/rehab)
- Football Sunday: intense match, lots of running
- Monday rest day
- Significant progressions across nearly all tracked lifts
- Sleep mostly good (one restless night from late screen time)
- Nutrition consistent—3 meals daily
- No creatine side effects

**Bodyweight:** 79kg

**Recovery:** 4/5 average

**Progressions:**

| Lift | Baseline | Week 2 | Change |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Weighted pull-ups | 40kg × 3 | 40kg × 4 | +1 rep |
| Squat | 130kg × 4 | 130kg × 7 | +3 reps |
| Bench press | 110kg × 3 | 110kg × 4 | +1 rep |
| Shoulder press | 70kg × 3 | 70kg × 4 | +1 rep |
| Bent over row | 110kg × 5 | 110kg × 6 | +1 rep |
| Deadlift | 160kg × 3 | 160kg × 3 | No change |
| Press-ups | 80 | 87 | +7 reps |

**Observations:**
- Deadlift held at baseline but 190kg attempt failed (previously hit in Week 0). Likely due to squatting 48 hours prior—hamstrings still sore. Also adjusting technique: shifting from back-dominant pull to more leg/glute drive off the floor. Expect strength to rebuild as new pattern becomes automatic.
- 48 hours not enough recovery between heavy squats and heavy deadlifts—schedule accordingly.
- Pump/fullness feeling inconsistent: returned mid-week, faded again by end of week.
- One restless night (Thursday) linked to late screen time before bed.
- Shoulder press 75kg × 1 achieved—nearly bodyweight overhead.
- Press-ups tested before bench (87 reps)—may have fatigued pressing strength.

**Reflection:**
Week 2 delivered more progression than expected. Every primary lift except deadlift improved, and press-ups jumped significantly. Hard to say how much is creatine versus recovered baseline week fatigue, but the trend is positive. Deadlift needs more attention—technique change is the right call long-term but means accepting a temporary plateau. Next week: prioritise spacing between squats and deadlifts, and retest bodyweight pull-ups if the opportunity comes up.

---

### Week 3
**Creatine phase:** Maintenance (5g/day)

**Summary:**
- 6 training sessions completed (chest/triceps, back, easy chest/back, legs, shoulders, arms/chest, back)
- Football Sunday: 70 mins, less intense than previous week, picked up minor groin niggle (recurring issue)
- Rough start to week—recovery 3/5 Monday and Tuesday after intense football previous Sunday
- Midweek improved after eating significantly more on Thursday
- 120kg bench × 1 achieved Saturday (failed in Week 2)
- 190kg deadlift × 1 achieved Thursday (technique broke down at max effort)
- No other tracked lift progressions this week
- Travelling to Montenegro Tuesday for rest week

**Bodyweight:** 78.7kg (unchanged from previous Tuesday, down from 79kg Week 2)

**Recovery:** 3.5/5 average (ranged from 2-4 across the week)

**Observations:**
- Football fatigue pattern confirmed: Sunday match = Monday/Tuesday compromised. Worse when match is intense or against younger players.
- Eating more (Thursday) led to noticeably better energy Friday. Usual 3 meals may not be enough on heavy training weeks.
- 190kg deadlift achieved Thursday but technique broke down at max effort. Submaximal technique improving.
- Post-meal tiredness after legs noted again—likely parasympathetic response, not food-related.
- Groin niggle returned during Sunday match—ongoing issue, not new.
- 30kg dumbbell shoulder press felt lighter than previous.
- Mindset shift: realised don't need to push every session, just train normally.

**Creatine observations:**
- No side effects
- No pump/fullness this week
- Doesn't feel like it's doing much currently

**Reflection:**
Week 3 was inconsistent. Started flat, recovered midweek, finished tired. The 120kg bench is a win—failed it two weeks ago, got it clean this week. But overall energy and recovery were lower than Week 2. The pattern is clear: football plus high training volume plus 10k daily steps is a lot. Heading to Montenegro for a rest week. No serious training planned—maybe 1-2 light sessions. Will continue creatine at 5g daily. Goal is to come back Week 5 fresh and see if the break helps.

---

### Week 4
**Creatine phase:** Maintenance (5g/day)

**Summary:**
- Rest week — travelling in Montenegro
- 4 training sessions (chest/back, back, shoulders/arms, full body with Saša)
- No football (away)
- Trained at Herkul Gym & Fitness — old-school bodybuilding gym with steel equipment and early morning techno
- Trained with owner Saša Rakočević, 63-year-old ex-bodybuilder and senior Mr Olympia competitor. Different training style: slow controlled reps, 10-second pauses, cable machines, bodybuilder approach. Recorded the session for him.
- Sunday: sledgehammer work smashing rocks in Cetinje mountains — no gym, but a solid workout
- Nutrition: different from usual — 1 meal at home (5 eggs), rest eating out, more snacking (cakes, chocolate), still prioritised protein when eating out
- Sleep: consistent 8 hours with natural wake-ups, except one 5-hour night

**Bodyweight:** 78.7kg (unchanged from Week 3)

**Recovery:** 4/5 average

**Observations:**
- Shoulder pain increased this week — likely aggravated by 50kg incline dumbbell press on Tuesday. This weight has caused issues before. Original injury was from incline pressing years ago. Worth avoiding heavy incline dumbbells going forward.
- Pump/fullness returned — noticed after weights sessions and especially after sledgehammer work. Could be creatine stores now saturated, higher carb intake, or lower training intensity allowing better blood flow.
- Different training style with Saša was refreshing — slower reps, more machines, less compound. Good variation.

**Creatine observations:**
- No side effects
- 5g daily maintained throughout trip
- Pump feeling back after being absent in Week 3

**Reflection:**
Week 4 was a proper rest week but not a complete break. Four lighter sessions, new gym, new training partner, different country. The body got a break from high-intensity compound lifting and football. Shoulder flared up from heavy incline — a reminder to respect that limitation. The pump returning is encouraging, whether it's creatine, carbs, or reduced fatigue.

---

### Week 5
**Creatine phase:** Maintenance (5g/day)

**Summary:**
- 6 training sessions (back/biceps with Saša in Montenegro, chest, legs, legs with Doktor, chest/shoulders, back)
- Football cancelled Sunday (waterlogged pitches) — trained back instead
- Back in London Wednesday, resumed normal routine
- Back-to-back leg days Thursday/Friday — first time doing this
- 200kg deadlift attempt: lifted it but technique broke down, didn't lock out. Tiny tweak at top of back, cleared quickly. Progress — previously couldn't lift 200kg at all.
- 100kg bench × 10 achieved Saturday — first time since November, was only getting 3 reps back then
- Training more freely now — less rigid structure, training with different partners

**Bodyweight:** 78.7kg (unchanged for third consecutive week)

**Recovery:** 4.5/5 average

**Observations:**
- Shoulder pain from Week 4 has settled — incline rest helped
- Bench showing two patterns: rep work improving (100kg × 10), but heavy singles still stuck (130kg attempt failed)
- Deadlift 160kg × 2 on Thursday, then 170kg × 4 on Friday. 200kg attempt showed progress despite not locking out.
- Technique note: at max weights (200kg), tendency to drive with back not legs. Same pattern as before — needs continued focus.
- Weight stable at 78.7kg for three weeks despite variable diet in Montenegro. Training volume and 10k steps maintained throughout.
- Back to 3 meals, greens, spinach — nutrition normalised.
- Training with different partners (Saša, Doktor) making sessions more enjoyable.
- Sleep consistent ~8 hours, waking naturally.

**Creatine observations:**
- No side effects
- 5g daily maintained
- No pump feeling this week

**Reflection:**
Week 5 marked the return to London and normal routine. Energy and recovery felt good — 4.5/5 is the highest weekly score so far. The 200kg deadlift attempt was a milestone even without the lockout. The 100kg × 10 bench is a clear win — proof that strength endurance is building even if max singles aren't moving yet. Back-to-back leg days were tough but manageable. The shift to training more freely — less rigid structure, more training partners — feels sustainable. Football cancelled gave an extra training day. Week 6 is the halfway testing week.

---

### Week 6
**Creatine phase:** Maintenance (5g/day)

**Summary:**
- 5 training sessions (back, legs, chest, shoulders, arms)
- No football (still cancelled)
- Originally planned as halfway testing week — became a normal training week due to fatigue
- Feeling tired throughout despite good sleep and nutrition
- Some tracked lifts tested, others skipped or not pushed to max

**Bodyweight:** 79.6kg (up from 78.7kg — likely delayed effect from Montenegro diet)

**Recovery:** 3.5/5 average (energy felt available but not translating to gym performance)

**Tracked lifts tested:**

| Lift | Baseline (W0) | Best So Far | Week 6 | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Pull-ups | 20 | — | 19 | To failure, slight drop |
| Bent over row | 110kg × 5 | 110kg × 6 (W2) | 120kg × 4 | New weight PR |
| Deadlift | 160kg × 3 | 170kg × 4 (W5) | 160kg × 6 | Rep PR at baseline weight |
| Dips | 54 | — | 45 | Down from baseline |
| Press-ups | 80 | 87 (W2) | 75 | Down from baseline and best |
| Shoulder press | 70kg × 3 | 70kg × 4 (W2) | 70kg × 2 | Didn't push for more |
| Bench press | 110kg × 3 | 110kg × 4 (W2) | 100kg × 6 | Didn't attempt 110kg |
| Squat | 130kg × 4 | 130kg × 7 (W2) | 120kg × 6 | Didn't attempt 130kg |
| Weighted pull-ups | 40kg × 3 | 40kg × 4 (W2) | — | Not tested at comparable weight |

**Observations:**
- Tiredness throughout the week despite good sleep, nutrition, and low stress. Possible overtraining.
- Energy felt present but didn't translate to performance when pushing heavy.
- Some lifts down from baseline (dips, press-ups) — likely fatigue, not regression.
- Bodyweight spiked to 79.6kg — highest of the study so far. Possibly water retention from increased carbs in Montenegro catching up.
- Not playing football as much recently — less conditioning but also less recovery demand.
- Pull-ups baseline comparison note: haven't trained max pull-ups to failure since Week 0. The 19 vs 20 isn't necessarily regression — just a snapshot under different conditions. Same applies to all tracked lifts — natural training progression, fatigue levels, and testing conditions all play a role.

**Creatine observations:**
- No side effects
- 5g daily maintained
- No pump feeling this week

**Reflection:**
Week 6 was meant to be the halfway testing week but the body wasn't cooperating. Instead of forcing PRs while fatigued, I treated it as a normal training week and logged what happened honestly. Some lifts showed progress (120kg row, 160kg × 6 deadlift), others dropped (dips, press-ups, shoulder press). The tiredness is hard to explain — sleep, nutrition, stress all fine. Possibly accumulated fatigue from back-to-back training weeks after Montenegro. Full retest saved for Week 12 when conditions are better. Next week: train normally, don't chase numbers, let the body recover.

---

### Week 7
**Creatine phase:** Maintenance (5g/day)

**Summary:**
- 5 training sessions (chest/back, shoulders, legs, back, chest)
- Football Sunday 16th: full 90 mins in rain and cold, first match in 2 weeks, groin niggle flared, double hamstring cramps that night
- Football cancelled Sunday 23rd — rest day
- Slow start to week due to football fatigue, recovered well by Thursday
- Two PRs: squat 130kg × 8 (was × 7), bench 110kg × 6 (was × 4)

**Bodyweight:** 79.2kg (down from 79.6kg — trending back toward baseline)

**Recovery:** 4/5 average (ranged from 3.5 to 4.5 across the week)

**Tracked lifts:**

| Lift | Baseline (W0) | Previous Best | Week 7 | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Bench press | 110kg × 3 | 110kg × 4 (W2) | 110kg × 6 | New PR, +3 reps from baseline |
| Squat | 130kg × 4 | 130kg × 7 (W2) | 130kg × 8 | New PR, had to push for it |
| Deadlift | 160kg × 3 | 170kg × 4 (W5) | 170kg × 3 | Slight drop from W5 best |
| Shoulder press | 70kg × 3 | 70kg × 4 (W2) | 70kg × 2 | Still below best |
| Press-ups | 80 | 87 (W2) | 75 | Still below best |

**Observations:**
- Football after 2 weeks off caused significant fatigue — double hamstring cramps, 3 days to fully recover. Groin niggle flared again (ongoing issue for 3 years).
- Pattern confirmed: need 3+ full days after intense football before legs session.
- Questioning whether early study results (Week 2) were inflated by novelty/ego/camera. Week 7 results feel more reflective of sustainable performance. Both are valid data points.
- Late heavy meal (bulgur and lamb shish) before bed affected sleep quality but not tiredness next day.
- Bodyweight trending down from 79.6kg peak — possibly returning to baseline as Montenegro diet effects clear.

**Creatine observations:**
- No side effects
- 5g daily maintained
- No pump feeling this week

**Reflection:**
Week 7 started rough after football but finished strong. The 110kg × 6 bench and 130kg × 8 squat are legitimate PRs — the strongest performances of the study so far. Deadlift and shoulder press still not matching Week 2 bests, but the trend is positive. The self-doubt about early results is honest — Week 2 may have been peak motivation, Week 7 is grind-it-out consistency. Both matter. Five weeks to go.
