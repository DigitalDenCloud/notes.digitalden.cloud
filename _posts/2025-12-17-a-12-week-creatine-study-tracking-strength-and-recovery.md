## Introduction

On 5 January 2026, I began a 12 week self-study to track the impact of creatine supplementation on strength training performance and recovery.

This post is a living document. It captures the protocol, baseline measurements, and is updated weekly as the study progresses.

I'm not expecting dramatic changes. Over the past year, improvements in diet, consistency, and recovery have already produced significant strength gains at a stable bodyweight of 78kg. This is the strongest I've been. The question is whether creatine supports continued progression when the fundamentals are already in place.

> **What this isn't**  
> This is not a supplement endorsement. Not a transformation narrative. Not an attempt to optimise every variable. It's a personal log tracking whether creatine makes a measurable difference under real-world conditions. Life continues—recovery sessions, travel days, Sunday football. When something deviates from routine, I note it. Otherwise, I train, eat, sleep, and document what happens.

## The Protocol

**Supplement:** Creatine Monohydrate from [Nutrition Geeks](https://www.nutritiongeeks.co/products/pure-creatine-monohydrate){:target="_blank"} — single ingredient, no additives.

![Creatine Monohydrate](/assets/img/posts/pure-creatine-monohydrate-powder-nutrition-geeks.webp){: .w-50 .left }

**Loading phase**
- 20 grams per day (5g × 4)
- Duration: 7 days

**Maintenance phase**
- 5 grams per day
- Duration: Remaining 11 weeks

Timing is not treated as a variable. Daily intake is prioritised over specific timing relative to training.

## Prior Creatine Use

Earlier in the year, I supplemented with approximately 3.5g of creatine per day for around 90 days. During that period, I achieved several lifetime personal records.

I then stopped supplementing. By the start of this study, I had been off creatine for approximately six weeks — enough time for muscle creatine levels to return close to baseline.

This study exists to test whether those earlier gains can be reproduced and documented under structured conditions.

## What I'm Tracking

### Primary Lifts

Six compound movements, each with a defined rep range:

| Lift | Rep Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Barbell bench press | 4–6 | |
| Bent over barbell row | 6–8 | |
| Standing shoulder press | 3–6 | |
| Squat | 3–5 | |
| Deadlift | 2–5 | Chalk and alternate grip |
| Weighted pull ups | 4–6 | Wide grip, full stretch |

For each lift, one top working set (the heaviest set within the rep range) is recorded, pushed to or near failure.

### Secondary Indicators

Bodyweight movements performed to technical failure, once per week:

| Exercise | Standard |
|----------|----------|
| Press ups | Nose to floor |
| Pull ups | Wide grip, full stretch |
| Dips | Bodyweight |

### Other Metrics

| Metric | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Bodyweight | Weekly (morning, fasted) |
| Recovery rating (1–5) | Weekly |
| Contextual notes | As needed |

---

## Week 0 — Baseline

Baseline testing completed across a training week prior to starting creatine. Full context documented in [Strength Snapshot — January 2026](https://notes.digitalden.cloud/posts/strength-snapshot-january-2026/){:target="_blank"}.

### Primary Strength Metrics

| Lift | Top Working Set | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Barbell bench press | 110kg × 3 | Within 4–6 rep range |
| Bent over barbell row | 110kg × 5 | Grip limited. Within 6–8 rep range. |
| Standing shoulder press | 70kg × 3 | Within 3–6 rep range. Third rep was a grind. |
| Squat | 130kg × 4 | Within 3–5 rep range |
| Deadlift | 160kg × 3 | Within 2–5 rep range |
| Weighted pull ups | 40kg x 3 | Within 4–6 rep range |

### Secondary Performance Indicators

| Exercise | Repetitions | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Press ups | 80 | Nose to floor |
| Pull ups | 20 | Full stretch at bottom |
| Dips | 54 | Bodyweight |

### Bodyweight and Recovery

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Bodyweight | 78kg | Stable for several months |
| Recovery rating | 4/5 | Average across baseline week |

### Baseline Notes

- Early sessions affected by underfuelling (2-meal days)
- Best performances came after rest day and consecutive 3-meal days
- 190kg deadlift PB achieved during baseline week (outside tracked rep range)
- 30 minutes rotator cuff rehab performed before each session

> **Baseline context**  
> These values represent typical training performance under normal conditions, not maximal effort or peak performance.

## Why These Rep Ranges

Rep ranges are lift-specific rather than standardised. Each reflects the movement's demands:

**Lower body (squats, deadlifts)** — Lower rep ranges. These lifts impose significant systemic fatigue. Heavier loading with fewer reps reduces fatigue accumulation and technical breakdown.

**Upper body pressing (bench, shoulder press)** — Moderate rep ranges. These respond well to heavier loading while allowing enough volume for progression signals.

**Rows** — Higher rep range. Preserves technical consistency and limits lower back fatigue under load.

This approach balances load intensity, fatigue management, and the ability to detect meaningful changes over time.

---

## What Counts as a Tracked Set

For each lift, only one set per week is recorded: the best qualifying set within the defined rep range.

> **Example**  
> If bench press sets are:  
> - 100kg × 6  
> - 105kg × 4  
> - 110kg × 3  
>  
> Only **105kg × 4** is recorded — the heaviest set within the 4–6 rep range.
{: .prompt-tip }

Progression is attempted when performance allows, not enforced on a fixed schedule. Holding performance under fatigue counts as a valid outcome.

---

## Testing Approach

Lifts are recorded when they occur naturally in training—not forced into every week to fill the table.

If a qualifying set happens (heaviest set within rep range), it gets logged. If a lift doesn't come up that week, the cell stays empty. Empty cells aren't gaps in the study—they're just weeks where that lift wasn't tested.

Dedicated testing weeks at **Week 6** (halfway) and **Week 12** (end) will hit all six primary lifts and three secondary indicators intentionally, mirroring the baseline week protocol. This gives three clean data points per lift (W0, W6, W12) plus any incidental progressions recorded along the way.

The goal is to track progression under normal training conditions, not to optimise the study at the expense of how I actually train.

---

## Lifestyle Context

These factors reflect my normal routine. Nothing was changed for the study.

### Training

- 5–6 sessions per week
- Morning training (typically 7:00–9:00)
- 60–90 minutes per session
- Fasted, with filter coffee beforehand
- Organised around movement patterns, not a fixed split

### Recovery

- ~8 hours sleep per night
- ~10,000 steps daily
- Sunday league football (90 mins, high intensity)
- Mondays typically rest days

### Nutrition

- ~150g protein per day (~1.9g per kg bodyweight)
- Moderate carbohydrates, minimal added sugar
- No alcohol
- 3 meals minimum (learned during baseline week that 2 meals affects performance)

### Other Supplements

These are part of my existing routine and unchanged during the study:

- Magnesium
- Vitamin D
- Omega 3
- Vitamin B12
- Zinc
- Lion's Mane
- Turmeric

## What I Expect

Creatine is not expected to override fatigue or force personal records.

The potential value lies in:
- Improved repeatability of heavy sets
- Better tolerance to training stress
- Fewer stalled sessions
- Supporting recovery between sessions

If creatine does nothing measurable, that's a valid finding. The goal is to document what actually happens, not to prove a predetermined conclusion.

## Weekly Notes

### Week 1
**Creatine phase:** Loading (20g/day)

**Summary:**
- 6 training sessions completed (chest, back/recovery, legs, back, shoulders, legs)
- No strength or endurance improvements yet—still recovering from heavy baseline week where I pushed for PRs
- Noticeable pump/fullness from around day 5-6, likely water being pulled into muscle
- No difficulty taking 20g across 4 doses, no GI issues from creatine itself
- Sleep consistent all week (~7-8 hours, 11pm to 6-7am)
- Nutrition on track—3 meals daily
- Football Sunday: first match after a month off due to Christmas, felt good, legs tired after in cold conditions
- Weighted pull-ups baseline established: 40kg × 3 reps

**Bodyweight:** 79.3kg at start of week (up from 78kg baseline). Dropped to 79kg by start of Week 2 despite loading—possible factors include Sunday football, sauna, or individual response to creatine.

**Recovery:** 3.5/5 average

**Observations:**
- Wednesday leg session impacted by doing 3 sets of sprints on speed machine (hit 20mph each set) before training. Heart rate stayed elevated, took about an hour to feel normal again. Energy depleted for the entire session. Second time this has happened—avoid high-intensity cardio before lifting going forward.
- Spinach on empty stomach post-training causes discomfort—fine later in day. To be tested further.
- Monday rest day followed by sauna (20 mins), swim (10 laps), steam room (10 mins) for recovery before starting Week 2.

**Reflection:** 
   
Going into Week 1, I wasn't sure what to expect from loading. Strength and endurance felt no different—if anything, I was weaker due to residual fatigue from baseline week. But the pump and fullness were noticeable by day 5-6. That's the first sign creatine is doing something, even if performance hasn't caught up yet.

Interestingly, two days into maintenance (5g/day), that pump feeling has faded. Could be the drop from 20g to 5g, could be coincidence, could be placebo wearing off. Worth watching over the coming weeks to see if it returns or stabilises.
