## Introduction

I have been refining my smash burger setup over the past few months. The meat and method are where I want them. The bun is the part I have not figured out yet.

Brioche has too much sugar for my preference. Standard burger buns are fine but nothing special. I have heard potato buns are soft, lightly sweet, and hold up well under a juicy burger, but it seems to be more of an American thing. Fresh ones are not available in the UK and the only options are frozen imports.

After watching a few YouTube videos, I realised I could make these myself. This post documents my first attempt. It is also the first time I have made dough or baked anything like this. I will be adding more attempts as I refine the recipe for my needs.

## Context

The bun needs to match the burger. I want excellence. This section explains the build so the requirements make sense. You can read how I make the smash burger in detail [here](https://notes.digitalden.cloud/){:target="_blank"}.

### Beef

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Cuts | Dry-aged ribeye cap + chuck |
| Fat ratio | ~25% |
| Preparation | Butcher-minced fresh |

I get my beef from [Notting Hill Fish + Meat Shop](https://nottinghillfishshop.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}. I have tried a lot of butchers and different cuts over the past few months, and this one tastes the best. The flavour really comes through on the smash, and because I only season with salt and pepper, you can tell when the beef is good. I ask them to mince it fresh while I wait, and I tell them I want a higher fat ratio for taste. They grind it medium, so it is coarser than typical mince.

There is something satisfying about watching him pull at the ribeye steak and then feed it through the mincer. Otherwise I can never really trust where the mince comes from or what cuts they use. I assume most butchers use off-cuts and people would not know any better.

>
The dry-aged ribeye cap is the outer muscle of the ribeye, sometimes called the spinalis. It is the most marbled, most flavourful part of the steak. Dry-aging concentrates that flavour further. On its own it would be too rich and loose for a burger, so I add chuck. Chuck comes from the shoulder. It has good fat content but also more connective tissue, which gives the mince structure and helps it hold together when smashed.

The blend gives me strong beef flavour from the ribeye cap, with enough body from the chuck to form a proper patty.

### Patties

Patties are portioned at 60g each. I experimented with 100g patties but they were difficult to smash from frozen. 60g is more sensible. This size smashes easily, maximises crust surface area, and cooks evenly. Protein is scaled by stacking patties rather than increasing thickness. A typical build uses two or three patties.

### Cooking

| Step | Method |
|------|--------|
| Surface | [ProCook Elite Tri-Ply Frying Pan 30cm](https://www.procook.co.uk/product/procook-elite-tri-ply-frying-pan-uncoated-30cm){:target="_blank"}, very hot |
| Fat | Refined avocado oil |
| Smash | Frozen ball placed on pan, smashed immediately on contact |
| Flip | Once only |
| Seasoning | Salt added after smashing, on exposed surface |

I love this pan. Uncoated stainless steel, handles high heat, and lasts forever. I look after it with Bar Keepers Friend!

### Why Make My Own Buns

I already [avoid supermarket bread](https://notes.digitalden.cloud/posts/sourdough-post/){:target="_blank"} because of preservatives and additives. The same applies to burger buns. I want to know what is in them and keep the ingredients minimal.

Making my own means I control the sugar, choose quality ingredients, and avoid preservatives entirely. I always try to use the best ingredients I can find. Kerrygold butter, good flour, real potato.

Potato buns are common in the US but not here. Frozen imports exist but do not match what I have read about. Making them myself was the obvious next step.

## Batch 1

This was my first time making dough from scratch. I was short on time at points during this batch, which affected some decisions. I wanted to see if the method works and identify what to adjust next time.

### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Brand / Source | Amount |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Flour | [M&S Canadian Very Strong White Bread Flour](https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-canadian-very-strong-white-bread-flour/528313011){:target="_blank"} | 560g |
| Yeast | [Allinson Easy Bake Yeast](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/allinsons-easy-bake-yeast/812479-260924-260925){:target="_blank"} | 8g |
| Butter | [Kerrygold Unsalted](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/kerrygold-unsalted-butter/876457-215271-215272){:target="_blank"} | 56g (dough) + 45g (glaze) |
| Milk | [Duchy Organic Unhomogenised Whole Milk](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/duchy-organic-unhomogenised-whole-milk-1-pint/015864-7587-7588){:target="_blank"} | 240g |
| Egg | Organic free range, Notting Hill Farmers Market | 1 large |
| Potato | [Waitrose Maris Piper](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-maris-piper-potatoes/085063-372142-43169){:target="_blank"}, boiled and mashed | 120g |
| Sugar | White granulated | 45g |
| Salt | Fine | 12g |
| Topping | Sesame seeds + flaky salt | To taste |

I chose Canadian very strong flour for gluten development. Kerrygold for flavour. Instant yeast for simplicity. Real potato for structure and moisture retention.

### Nutrition per Bun

Based on the recipe yielding 12 buns:

| Nutrient | Per Bun (90g) |
|----------|---------------|
| Calories | ~220 kcal |
| Protein | ~6g |
| Carbohydrates | ~38g |
| Fat | ~5g |
| Sugar | ~4g |

This is lower in sugar than brioche, which typically has 6–8g per bun. The potato adds moisture without adding much sugar.

### Method

#### Step 1: Mashed Potato

Boiled one medium potato until soft. Mashed smooth. Weighed out 120g for the dough.

#### Step 2: Mixing

Combined mashed potato, milk, egg, and cold butter (straight from the fridge, did not have time to bring it to room temperature). Added sugar, salt, flour, and instant yeast.

#### Step 3: Kneading

Mixed by hand, then kneaded for 10–12 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough passed the windowpane test.

> **Windowpane test**  
> Stretch a small piece of dough thin enough to see light through it. If it tears before becoming translucent, continue kneading.

#### Step 4: First Rise

Shaped dough into a ball. Placed in an oiled bowl, covered, and left at room temperature for approximately one hour.

The dough rose slightly. I then refrigerated it for approximately two hours due to a scheduling constraint. This slowed fermentation but did not stop it.

#### Step 5: Post-Fridge Rest

Removed dough from fridge. Left at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes before shaping.

#### Step 6: Shaping

Punched down the dough. Turned out onto a clean surface and divided into 12 portions at 90g each. Trimmed and redistributed where necessary to make weights consistent.

Shaped each portion into a smooth ball, flattened slightly, and placed on a parchment-lined tray with approximately 2.5cm spacing.

#### Step 7: Second Rise

Covered and left to rise for approximately 45 minutes until puffy and nearly doubled.

#### Step 8: Bake

Preheated oven to 190°C. Brushed each bun with melted butter and added sesame seeds. Baked for 16 minutes until golden.

#### Step 9: Finish

Brushed hot buns with remaining melted butter. Added flaky salt. Cooled uncovered on a wire rack.

Texture improved significantly after approximately 45 minutes of cooling.

#### Step 10: Freeze

Sliced each bun in half and placed into freezer bags. Stored in the freezer. I toast them straight from frozen when needed.

### Observations

| Attribute | Observation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Texture | Soft, slightly dense |
| Structure | Strong, held up under a triple-stack with cheese |
| Size | 90g felt small relative to the burger build |
| Crust | Golden, butter glaze worked well, sesame seeds adhered |
| Cooling | Texture settled and improved after full cooling |

The buns performed well structurally. No collapse or sogginess under a 180g beef stack with melted American cheese. The density was acceptable but could be lighter. The main issue was size. 90g buns felt undersized for the intended build.

For a first attempt at baking, I was pleased with the result.

### Notes for Next Batch

| Area | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| Size | Increase to 105–110g per bun |
| Potato | Try 150g mash for softer crumb |
| Enriched mash | Mash while hot, beat in 20g butter and 30g warm milk, cool before adding to dough |
| Butter | Reduce standalone butter by 20g, bring remainder to room temperature |
| Milk | Reduce standalone milk by 30g |
| Hydration | Adjust if dough feels too stiff or too wet |
| Proofing | Allow longer second rise if time permits |
| Flour | Keep current (performed well) |
| Yeast | Keep current (performed well) |
| Structure | Maintain, do not sacrifice for softness |

The method works. The next batch focuses on scaling bun size and improving softness while preserving structure.

Enriching the mash should help with tenderness. Warm potato absorbs fat and liquid better than cold dough does. When you mash butter and milk into hot potato, the starches swell and trap the fat. That fat stays suspended in the potato rather than coating the flour proteins. This means gluten can still develop properly while the potato adds tenderness throughout. Total fat and liquid stays the same, the difference is where it sits in the dough.
